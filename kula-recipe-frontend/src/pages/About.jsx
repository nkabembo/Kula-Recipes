      <p style={{padding: "0.5em 4em", fontSize: "36px"}}><b>Kula</b> means to eat in swahili, a language spoken across africa. The idea came about to have a list of traditional authentic congolese recipes,
       dishes I grew up eating and cherish and being able to share that with the world.I have not seen a platform where congolese cuisines , even african are celebrated and showcased in a centralised area.Large wooden mortars(explains the logo) are a cooking tool often used in congolese cuisine to pound cassava and chillies for exam</p>
